# Basaran

Basaran is an API server for text generation using autoregressive language models. It provides a streaming API based on [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format) that supports various decoding strategies. With a powerful language model, Basaran can be used as an open source alternative to the [OpenAI text completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create).
